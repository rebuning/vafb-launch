# vafb-launch
This is a collection of Python 3 programs used for determining distance from launch pads at VAFB, Calif.

As a NASA Solar System Ambassador I often times set up public outreach opportunities at rocket launches that originate
from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, CA. I deal specifically with the science based missions although I sometimes
just love to observe the military themed ICBM tests that are conducted from this facility.

There are many questions that always arise about rocket launches and the science behind them. I use the launch opportunities 
to teach the public about science (physics) in general as well as the science going aloft on the rocket. A question that 
always comes up is... How far are we from the launch pad? There is an obsession with being closer... must get closer or...
we might miss it??

This respository contains a bunch of simple Python programs that work with GPS coordinates to determine how far we are away
from the various launch pads at the base. We also use the speed at which sound travels to determine how far away we were 
from the pad.

I hope you enjoy using these programs as much as I enjoyed creating them..
